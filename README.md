Requirements
---
PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.

Installation
---
Create new database as "todo_tasks_db".

Import "tasks" table using `task.sql` file.

Run the app as usual

`Make sure the directory name is "task/"`
